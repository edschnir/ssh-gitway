Howdy!
You've reached SSH GitWay - a routing ssh-git gateway.

SSH GitWay does not provide shell access. So you might want to try something like the following instead:

  git clone "ext::ssh -A your-team@gitway-host %S /username/your-repo.git"

The above will vary depending on SSH GitWay's configuration.
If you need further assistance, please contact your system administrator.
